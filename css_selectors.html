Battlegrounds Mobile India is a battle royale game, in which up to 100 players compete in a large-scale 
last man standing deathmatch. Players can enter the match as individuals or as small groups of up to four.
Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the several maps. Each round, 
the plane's flight path across the map changes, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to
eject and parachute to the ground. Players begin with no equipment other than customised clothing
options that have no effect on gameplay. Once on the ground, players can search buildings, ghost towns,
and other locations for weapons, vehicles, armour, and other items. At the start of a match, 
these items are procedurally distributed throughout the map, with higher-risk zones typically having
better equipment. Finished players can also be looted for their gear. Players can choose to play in
first-person or third-person, with each having advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational 
awareness.
